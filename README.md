# License
This repository hosts the source code for the license API of the 5GMETA platform.

For the platform operator, the license API allows the management of the dataflow licenses to be made available to the data consumers i.e. creation, update and deletion.

For the data consumers, the license API allows to retrieve the available dataflow licenses.

## API Description
The yaml description of the APIs is available in [api](https://github.com/5gmeta/license/tree/main/api).    
   
- `GET /licenses` lists all the available licenses
- `GET /licenses/{license_id}` returns the details of a single license (for the platform operator only)
- `POST /licenses/{license_id}` creates a new license (for the platform operator only)
- `PUT /licenses/{license_id}` updates a license (for the platform operator only)
- `DELETE /licenses/{license_id}` deletes a license (for the platform operator only)

## Requirements
To use this module you will need:
* Python 3.5.2+
* PIP
* MongoDB

By default the module looks for its `license-data` database on the `mongodb://localhost:27017`

You can install the community edition of the MongoDB server following the [official instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/). 

## Run
Once the requirements are fullfilled you can run the API with:

```
cd src/license-api
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

## Container
To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```

Running this container also require MongoDB on `mongodb://localhost:27017`

## Using the module
Once running you can access the swagger at 
```
http://localhost:8080/license-api/ui
```

## Kubernetes
A Kubernetes pod is available at `deploy/5gmeta-license-pod.yml`, running automatically the required MongoDB for the module.

You will need to update it with your own namespace.

The pod pull the image from 5GMETA private Docker Hub so [registering credentials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line) is required.
